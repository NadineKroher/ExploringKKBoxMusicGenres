EXPLORING THE GENRES OF THE KK-BOX MUSIC RECOMMENDATION DATASET

A while ago, KKBox [1] launched a music recommendation challenge on Kaggle [2]. They released a large dataset (>7M rows) containing information on which users listened to which song frequently. For each song, a bunch of additional info was given, including a list of genre IDs. 

Even without knowing what these IDs stand for, my idea is to explore popularity and similarities among them from a user-perspective and show all this in a nice graph.

More info coming soon...
