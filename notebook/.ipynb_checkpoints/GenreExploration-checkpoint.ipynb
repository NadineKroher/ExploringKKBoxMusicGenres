    "In this kernel, I explore the <b>genres</b> with respect to <b>listener behaviour</b> and co-occurrence. Are there pairs or groups of genres, which are commonly listened to by the same users? We could use this type of user-driven genre similarity as a feature in recommender systems, in particular for cold-start cases. Let's say, people who like <i>alternative rock</i> commonly also like <i>indie</i> - we can recommend <i>indie</i> songs to new users who only listened to a few <i>alternative rock</i> tracks so far. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we only have the genre-IDs and don't know their \"physical\" meaning, we cannot use any higher-level background info (i.e. from music genre taxonomies). My idea for this kernel is to model genres in a <b>graph</b>. Each genre represents a node, associated with a node score which indicates how often this genre appears in the train set. Edges between nodes represent co-occurrences. The edge weights indicate how often a single user in the train set liked (by means of target = 1) both genres. For example, if the edge weight between <i>alternative rock</i> and <i>indie</i> has weight 500, this means that there are 500 users with at least one song with target = 1 and <i>alternative rock</i> as a genre tag, who also have at least one song with target = 1 and <i>indie</i> tag. \n",

    "I first construct a similarity matrix from the training data, then convert it to a networkx graph and use a 2-D layout to visualise genre similarities and popularities. "
